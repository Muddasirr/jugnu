            Whether it's reaching out for support you feel is long overdue or you've taken the courageous step to leave a harmful relationship, seeking help and speaking up can feel daunting.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope to connect you with trusted resources, safety, and caring and survivor-led support.
          </p>
          <p>
            By grounding our work in these intersections, survivors see themselves in our work, their experiences are met with understanding, and their solutions are trusted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Women's workshops is a unique place: there is nowhere else that survivors of violence can self-refer and leave with a personalized service package.
